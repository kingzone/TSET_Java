"1","Legacy                        ","Traditional (V2R6 & prior releases) cost values for legacy optimizer cost formulas. These use the traditional values and formula in determining query plan costs."
"2","Type2                         ","Initialization and cost parameters for Type 2 formulas.  Since IO and Bynet costing still use Legacy formulas, IO and Network parameters are the same as Legacy, but with different ConstId values."
